End-to-End Inverse Kinematics Framework for 6-RSS Stewart Platform
using LSTM-based Deep Neural Network
Joonho Seo*, Seongbo Shim, and Deokgi Jeong


   Abstract: This paper proposes an end-to-end inverse kinematics (IK) solution using an Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) for position control of a 6-RSS Stewart platform. It aims to compute the joint angles of six rotary motors to
   achieve the desired platform pose. To this end, a dataset is collected by tracking the platform pose with an Optical
   Tracking System (OTS) while simultaneously measuring joint angles. To learn the non-linear relationship between
   the desired pose and joint angles while preserving the temporal continuity of robot motion, a hybrid architecture
   combining a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) was proposed. The
   conventional closed-form IK solution is also implemented for comparison. Given the same input trajectories, the
   proposed IK solution achieved a tracking performance comparable to the closed-form solution, maintaining an
   RMSE deviation within 2% of the analytical baseline. Moreover, we demonstrated the robustness of the proposed
   IK solution by validating it under fault conditions where the closed-form solution is unable to adapt. The results
   suggest that the proposed learning-based IK solution is a suitable alternative for the kinematic control of complex
   mechanisms, maintaining high accuracy even in the presence of modeling uncertainties.

   Keywords: 6-RSS Stewart platform, deep neural network, end-to-end learning, inverse kinematics, LSTM.

for 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) serial robotic arms have
been introduced [10–14], and several approaches have
also been proposed to address the IK of high-DoF re-
