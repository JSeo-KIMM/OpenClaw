   Several studies have applied similar AI-based kinematic
analysis strategies to various robot structures. In partic-
ular, artificial neural network (ANN)-based IK solutions
for 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) serial robotic arms have
been introduced [10–14], and several approaches have
also been proposed to address the IK of high-DoF re-
dundant manipulators [15, 16]. Additionally, Bai [17] and
